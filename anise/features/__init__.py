##@package anise.features
## anise Features - everything it does on top of the bare platform.
##
## Anise features are a plugin system. All high-level functionality of anise is implemented in one of the
## features which are bundled with anise. They are loaded by the feature loader anise.framework.features at runtime.
##
## Read more general information in \ref _features "Features" and more about the specific features here.
##
## Note: In order to actually understand what the features do and how to use them, it will be needed to study
## anise _projectdesc file and those of my other projects as examples as well as the anise sources.
